A fill command that fills inputs faster than the cypress native type command.

This package adds a custom [Cypress][cypress] command that fills inputs and textareas. The type command from cypress has 10ms delay, so it slows the tests a bit. This command doesn't have any delay at all.

## Installation

The package is distributed via [npm][npm] and should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

## Usage

`cypress-fill-command` extends Cypress' `cy` command.
Add this line to your project's `cypress/support/commands.js`:

```javascript
import 'cypress-fill-command'
```

Now you are ready to use the command. Here is a basic example:

```javascript
cy.get('#the-element-id').fill(/Button Name/)
```

## API

Exposed command in a nutshell:

```javascript
cySubject.fill(text)
```

- {String} `text` â€“ The text to be filled into an input

## It isn't working!

It has been used on a React project with inputs controlled by React state.

I cannot guarantee it will work in any custom input, but we can try to improve it, just open an issue or a PR.
